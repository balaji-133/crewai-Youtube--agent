# 🤖 CrewAI Multi-Agent Blog Generator

This project demonstrates how to build a **multi-agent AI system** using **CrewAI** to research a topic and generate a well-structured blog post.

The project focuses on **agent collaboration**, **task orchestration**, and **modular AI design**, rather than relying on a single AI model.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Creating high-quality technical content usually requires:
- Researching information from multiple sources
- Structuring the content clearly
- Writing in a readable and engaging format

Doing all of this manually is **time-consuming and repetitive**.

This project solves that problem by using **multiple AI agents**, each responsible for a specific role, working together like a real team.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

- Demonstrate **how AI agents can collaborate**
- Separate responsibilities between agents
- Automate research and content generation
- Show a **real-world use case of CrewAI**
- Build a beginner-friendly, extensible project

---

## 🧠 Agents Used in the Project

### 1️⃣ Blog Researcher Agent
- Researches the given topic
- Breaks it down into simple explanations
- Identifies comparisons, use cases, and key points
- Thinks like an educational content creator

### 2️⃣ Blog Writer Agent
- Takes the research output
- Converts it into a structured blog post
- Writes in clear and simple language
- Produces a final Markdown file

Each agent has a **single responsibility**, making the system modular and scalable.
